# 30DayMapChallenge 2020

This repository includes the maps produced for the 2020 edition of the **#30DayMapChallenge** üåéüåèüåé

#30DayMapChallenge is a daily mapping/cartography/data visualization challenge aimed at the spatial community, launched by [Topi Tjukanov](https://twitter.com/tjukanov) and happening on Twitter. The rules are simple: create and publish maps about different themes on each day of November using the hashtag #30DayMapChallenge. Maps can be prepared in advance but shall be published on specific days according to the themes listed below. No registration to the challenge is required and there are no restrictions on the tools, technologies and data that can be used in the maps. There is also no obligation to publish alle the 30 maps. The 2020 #30DayMapChallenge is announced in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/tjukanov/status/1311568912950140930) and the full information, including a code of conduct, is available [here](https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge).

Producing 30 maps in 30 days is really hard, so this year I joined forces with my colleague [Valentina Alberti](https://twitter.com/v_valealb), an enthusiast of GIS, data and dataviz just like me! Together we produced the 30 maps that you can see below, which were all published on [my Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/MarcoMinghini) under a [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license (except where otherwise stated). The data sources, the software used for each map and the tweet where the map was published are mentioned below. Our friends for the challenge were a family of little gnomes that appeared in all our 30 maps. We hope you will enjoy the gallery!
